#  Local Skill Exchange (No Money System)

A community-driven web platform where people exchange skills using **time instead of money**.

---

##  Project Idea

Many people have useful skills but cannot afford paid services. At the same time, many people need help but lack money.

**Local Skill Exchange** solves this problem by allowing users to trade skills using **hour-based credits**, creating a fair and inclusive system.

>  1 hour of any skill = 1 credit  
>  No money involved

---

##  Problem Statement

- Skilled people lack income opportunities
- Learners cannot afford services
- Money-based platforms create inequality
- Trust and payment disputes are common

---

##  Solution

A **web-based skill exchange platform** where:
- Users offer their skills
- Earn time credits by helping others
- Spend credits to learn new skills
- Everything stays within the local community

---

##  How It Works

1. User signs up and creates a profile
2. Adds:
   - Skills they can offer
   - Skills they want to learn
3. Sends or receives skill requests
4. Skill exchange happens (online for Now)
5. Credits are updated after mutual confirmation

---

##  Example
"I design posters for 1 hour"
↔
"You teach me guitar for 1 hour"

---

##  Features (MVP)

- User authentication
- Skill listing (offer & request)
- Hour-based credit system
- Skill request & approval
- Rating and feedback system
- Local/community-based matching
